Learn Data Science with R 

R has become a popular programming language for processing data and graphics:
1. Many data processing options with a very complete number of features
2. It is faster to learn and run to process data
3. R is free and open source.

Big companies that use R include 
- AirBnB for data science, 
- Microsoft to add functionality to their products, 
- Uber for statistical analysis, 
- Facebook for behavior analysis, and others.

This repository contains what I've learned about R for Data Science. Happy reading, waiting for the collaboration
